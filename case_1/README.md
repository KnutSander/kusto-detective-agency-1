# Case 1: The Rarest Book is Missing!

Finding the book proved an interesting challenge. I quickly realised it had to do with comparing the total weight of the books on the shelf, i.e. the weight the shelf should have, and the weight of the shelf according to the data.
After that it was a case of simply finding the correct commands to figure out which one had the highest difference.
