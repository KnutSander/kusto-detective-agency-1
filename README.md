Join my on my journey to become a master at the Kusto Query Language and the Azure Data Explorer through many attempts at cracking the increasingly difficult cases from the Kusto Detective Agency.

**Note**: The solutions found in this repository are by far not the only possible solutions for the cases, but simply the ones I cobbled together with my current understanding of KQL and ADE.
