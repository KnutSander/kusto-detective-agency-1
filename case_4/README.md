# Case 4 - Ready to Play

This was by far the most challenging case so far, and had several different steps that required different ways of approaching them. Finding the *special* prime number was easy enough given the provided resources. </br>
The real challenge was trying to find the location described on the second part of the challenge. Finding the right columns of data to filter by and use was the majority of work, then using the **geo_point_to_h3cell()** function to get the coordinates of "El Puenet", who was not as easy to see as expected. After that it was as simple as using the provided key and decrypting the message.
